👩‍💻 Hi, my name is Sophia! I am a software engineer and linguistics enthusiast. 
¡Hola, Me llamo Sophia! Soy una ingeniera de software y una entusiastica de la lingüística.
Hei, jeg heter Sophia! Jeg er programvareingeniør og lingvistikkentusiast.

🎓I am a 2020 graduate of Saint Vincent College with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.

💛 I am a Pittsburgh local who is proud to be a woman in STEM. 
I am passionate about developing meaningful tech that can improve the world and give others the opportunity for a better life. 

📚 From an early age I have always been curious about how things work and why, especially about language.
When I started studying Spanish, I fell in love with the language and all of the culture it opened me up to. 
Because of this, I combined my love of language with my love of mathematics in college and decided to study computer science. 
During my studies, I developed skills in project management, leadership, and documentation on top of my new-found programming experience. 
My senior year, during the pandemic, I was the SCRUM Master and Lead Front-End Developer on my Senior Software Engineering Project team, 
and we were successfully able to design and prototype a social media site around Ham Radio, called Hamplify. This is still one of my proudest accomplishments.

🤝 In the future I would love to use my skills and passions to make a meaningful impact on the world. 
I care deeply about inclusivity, sustainability, and equality, and I see tech as the path through which all of these can be accomplished. 
My goal is to be a part of that. As a woman from an academic background, I love learning and want to never stop gaining knowledge and sharing it with others. 
I also want to use my love of language to broaden my own experience of the world and help others do the same, 
because I believe communication and collaboration are the most important parts of a good team and a good society.

🚶‍♀️ Outdoors, you can find me hiking and people watching. 
Indoors I love knitting, reading, playing D&D, and learning new languages on Duolingo (my current language is Norwegian!) 
I am an avid cook, and my biggest cooking accomplishments to date are homemade bagels 🥯 and tamales from scratch.
